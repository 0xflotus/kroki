= Install Kroki

To convert plain text diagrams to images with Kroki,
you first need to install the gateway server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
We recommend to install Kroki using Docker, especially if you don't want to manually install diagrams libraries.

However, you can manually install the diagrams libraries that you want to use and run the gateway server as a standalone executable _jar_.
Consult the xref:manual-install.adoc[manual install documentation] to find out how.
====

== Using Docker

 $ docker run yuzutech/kroki

== Companion Containers

If you want to use _BlockDiag_, _ActDiag_, _NwDiag_, _SeqDiag_ or _Mermaid_, then you will also need to start companion containers.

You can use `docker-compose` to run multiple containers:

.docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: "3"
services:
 core:
   image: yuzutech/kroki
   environment:
     - KROKI_BLOCKDIAG_HOST=blockdiag
     - KROKI_MERMAID_HOST=mermaid
   ports:
     - "8000:8000"
 blockdiag:
   image: yuzutech/kroki-blockdiag
   ports:
     - "8001:8001"
 mermaid:
   image: yuzutech/kroki-mermaid
   ports:
     - "8002:8002"
```

 $ docker-compose up -d
